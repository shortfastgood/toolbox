Apache James
--

The [Apache James](http://james.apache.org/) is a e-mail server written in Java, I use it as development server. Here
I keep a small installation/configuration script for Ubuntu Linux which should work for for any Debian based distribution.

The installation script requires a Java JDK already installed on the machine. For example on my Ubuntu 12.04 LTS I did install:

    apt-get install openjdk-7-jre-headless
    apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk
